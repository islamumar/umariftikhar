    Born and raised in Sialkot,<br> I discovered my fascination for technology early on. Now, as a BS IT student at the University of Sialkot** <br>, I'm diving into the world of code, databases, and networks. Late nights in the library, coding marathons, and hackathonsâ€”this is my journey. My dream? To be a software architect, shaping digital landscapes.
    
    So here I am, a blend of curiosity, caffeine, and code. The journey has just begun, and I'm eager to see where it leads.
